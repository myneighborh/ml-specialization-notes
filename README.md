# Machine Learning Specialization

This repository contains reimplementations of the *Machine Learning Specialization* by DeepLearning.AI, Stanford University.

## Courses Followed

### 1. [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](./01_supervised_learning)
- Build machine learning models in Python using popular libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn  
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks,  
  including linear regression and logistic regression

### 2. [Advanced Learning Algorithms](./02_advanced_algorithms)
- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification  
- Apply best practices for machine learning development to ensure generalization to real-world data and tasks  
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

### 3. [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](./03_unsupervised_learning)
- Use unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and anomaly detection
