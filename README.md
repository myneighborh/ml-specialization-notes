# Machine Learning Specialization

This repository contains implementations of the *Machine Learning Specialization* by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.  
The original courses use TensorFlow, but all deep learning models have been re-implemented in this repository using PyTorch.

## Courses Followed

### 1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
- Build machine learning models in Python using popular libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn  
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks,  
  including linear regression and logistic regression

### 2. Advanced Learning Algorithms
- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification  
- Apply best practices for machine learning development to ensure generalization to real-world data and tasks  
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

### 3. Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
- Use unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and anomaly detection  
- Build recommender systems using a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based recommendation method  
- Build a deep reinforcement learning model
